# 🧥 Invisible Cloak using OpenCV (Black Cloak Edition)

A real-time computer vision project that recreates the **“Invisibility Cloak” effect** inspired by Harry Potter using **OpenCV and Python**.

The system detects a black-colored cloak and replaces it with a pre-captured background, making the wearer appear invisible in real-time.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates practical use of:

- Color detection in HSV space  
- Real-time video processing  
- Background subtraction and replacement  
- Webcam-based computer vision  

---

## 🎯 Features

✔ Real-time video processing with OpenCV  
✔ Black cloak detection using HSV filtering  
✔ Background replacement for invisibility effect  
✔ Saves background as `.mp4`  
✔ Works with any webcam  
✔ Lightweight and easy to run

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Capture background without subject  
2. Detect black cloak using HSV color segmentation  
3. Create mask for cloak area  
4. Replace cloak region with background  
5. Display output in real-time  

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  

---

## ▶️ Usage

### Step 1 — Capture Background

Record a few seconds of empty background.
---
### Step 2 — Run Cloak Effect


Wear a **black cloak/cloth** and stand in front of camera.

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- Use plain background  
- Ensure good lighting  
- Avoid black clothes except cloak  
- Keep camera stable  

---

## 🚀 Applications

- Augmented Reality  
- Film & video effects  
- Background subtraction systems  
- Human-computer interaction  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Deep learning segmentation  
- Multi-color cloak detection  
- Edge device optimization  
- Performance improvements
